How the Phishing Attack Works

1. The attacker sends a fake email pretending to be a social media platform.
2. The email claims that 3 people have started following the user.
3. The message creates curiosity and urgency to make the user act quickly.
4. The user clicks the provided link without verifying the sender.
5. The link redirects the user to a fake website controlled by the attacker.
6. The attacker may steal login credentials or personal information.
